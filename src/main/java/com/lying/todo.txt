Craftable Sage Hat, wearable as a helmet with a custom model
Custom entity data for all nascent Tricksy mobs (initially just foxes), tracking what they've done whilst meeting a simple prerequisite
When conditions are properly met, the entity data replaces the nascent mob with its enlightened version
	For foxes, these conditions are to be holding an amethyst shard and travelling to both the Nether, the End, and back to the Overworld in any sequence
Enlightened (aka Tricksy) mob is a complete custom mob with its own custom model
	Tricksy mobs cannot be bred with their nascent form and breeding with one-another only produces the baby of their nascent form
	Tricksy mobs contain an owner UUID, set once by right-clicking them a Sage Hat, which itself stores the same UUID in its item NBT
	Tricksy mobs contain NBT-storeable behaviour tree and NBT-storeable local whiteboard. This tree is stored in their entity data and should be modifiable by their master using a custom UI screen.
	Tricksy mobs treat any player wearing a corresponding Sage Hat as their "master" and can access a global whiteboard registered server-side with the same owner UUID
	Tricksy mobs initialise with a simple follow-owner behaviour tree
Behaviour trees can be up to a server-set max size with a variety of predefined actions to allow mobs to perform various actions, like attack, extract/deposit items, etc.
	Stringing actions together in custom behaviour trees then lets players "program" them to do many things, including automation
Craftable custom item for marking positions and orientations, nameable in an anvil, give to a tricksy mob to set a value in its local whiteboard
